# Smart Buildings and Neighborhoods 🏘️

## Overview 🏠

This project focuses on designing and implementing a system to manage sensors deployed in different buildings. The system collects data, including temperature and humidity, from various sensors and uses this data to trigger commands on nearby actuators. Furthermore, the collected data undergo further analysis to retrieve statistics.

## Technologies Used 🛠️

- Contiki NG: Manages sensors.
- Node-Red: Manages connection flows, such as sensor configuration and data storing.
- Apache Spark: Analyzes data and retrieves useful statistics.
- MQTT: Used for communication.

## University Course 📖

This is the project of the exam "Middleware Technologies and Distributed Systems" for the Computer Science and Engineering degree at Polytechnic of Milano.
